<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>We had a task where workers looked at some text and find words that 
are parts of proper nouns such as people name, organization names and 
places.</p>

<p>Now we want to know whether you can predict if a worker miss a word, after looking at labels by that worker.</p>

<p><strong>Worker summary:</strong></p>

<p>You will first look at a summary of the labels by a particular 
worker. You will see the sentences and the proper nouns in bold and 
whether the worker the worker miss each proper noun. For example:</p>

<table class="table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Word</th>
			<th>Miss</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<div>Itâ€™s official: Obama attending <b>APEC</b> Summit in Manila</div>
			</td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The time is 05:30 <b>GMT</b></td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the first row, APEC is an organization name and should be marked 
but the worker missed that. In the second row, the worker missed GMT 
(another all-uppercase word).</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>You will then answer some question. Each question contains two words;
 worker gave the correct labels for one of those and the wrong label for
 the other. Your task is to guess which word did the worker miss. For 
examples:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>New York</strong>&nbsp; Metropolitan Opera suspends conductor James Levine</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; One dead after hit-and-run driver strikes six in Queens, <strong>NY</strong></p>

<p>If you believe the worker is not good at all-uppercase words, you should select 2.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong></p>

<p>Try to find what types of words in what types of sentences that the worker missed and did not miss.</p>

<p>If you have absolutely no clue, you can select the option "Can't tell"</p>
