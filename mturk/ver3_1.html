<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>We had a task where workers looked at some text and find words that 
are parts of proper nouns such as people name, organization names and 
places.</p>

<p>Now we want to know whether you can predict if a worker miss a word, after looking at labels by that worker.</p>

<p><strong>Worker summary:</strong></p>

<p>You will first look at a summary of the labels by a particular 
worker. You will see the sentences and the proper nouns in bold and 
whether the worker the worker miss each proper noun. For example:</p>

<table class="table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Word</th>
			<th>Miss</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<div>It’s official: Obama attending <b>APEC</b> Summit in Manila</div>
			</td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Where APEC is an organization name and should be marked but the 
worker missed that. The sentences by that workers are organized given in
 <strong>Tables</strong> . Each table includes sentences that are similar. For example:</p>

<p><strong>Table 1</strong></p>

<table class="table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Word</th>
			<th>Miss</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<div>It’s official: Obama attending <b>APEC</b> Summit in Manila</div>
			</td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<div>The time is 05:30 <b>GMT</b></div>
			</td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<div><b>BME</b> repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp&nbsp;</div>
			</td>
			<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>50 more rows in this table</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Majority features:&nbsp;All characters are uppercases;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>In this table, you see three examples of sentences and the words that
 the worker missed. You also see that the table has 50 more rows (which 
are not shown). Lastly, you see the Majority feature: all characters are
 uppercases, meaning that the majority of sentences in this table have 
the bold word with that feature. This suggests that the worker here is 
not good at labeling all-uppercase words.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>You will then answer some question. Each question contains two words;
 worker gave the correct labels for one of those and the wrong label for
 the other. Your task is to guess which word did the worker miss. For 
examples:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>New York</strong>&nbsp; Metropolitan Opera suspends conductor James Levine</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; One dead after hit-and-run driver strikes six in Queens, <strong>NY</strong></p>

<p>If you believe the worker is not good at all-uppercase words, you should select 2.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong></p>

<p>Try to find what types of words in what types of sentences that the worker missed and did not miss.</p>

<p>If you have absolutely no clue, you can select the option "Can't tell"</p>
